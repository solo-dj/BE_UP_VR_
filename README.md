This is an Educational VR app created by our team leaded by Solomon Sagayam DJ to overcome Neurodevelopmental disorder. We used Unity along with Google Cardboard VR SDK which gives us the access to operate in any mobile operating platform.

TITLE OF THE PROJECT :

ACCOMMODATIVE VIRTUAL REALITY EDUCATIONAL GAME FOR PEOPLE WITH NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER

PROBLEM STATEMENT :

The problem statement is to develop an adaptive virtual reality educational game that can cater to the individual learning needs of individual with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder ,ADHD, and learning disabilities.

Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that is becoming more widely used than ever. However, regarding people suffering from Neurodevelopment Disorder(NDD),using it may be difficult and frustrating, as most programs are not developed with these people needs in mind. In this project, we try to address this issue by implementing an adaptive system, aware of the events taking place within it and capable of adjusting itself, thereby modulating the complexity of the gameplay. The application we’re developed is an educational Android game that takes place in VR environment, and is designed in way that aims to minimize explicit user input, relying instead on behavior analysis and gaze input tracking. A psychologist should accompany to monitor his/her progress, provide assistance when needed, and analyze the results to further understand the user’s conditions.

PROPOSED SYSTEM :

The proposed system is an adaptive virtual reality Android game that takes place in a VR environment, designed to cater to the unique needs of individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD). The game uses behavior analysis and gaze input tracking to minimize explicit user input and modulate the complexity of gameplay based on the user's behavior. A psychologist accompanies the user during gameplay to monitor their progress, provide assistance when needed, and analyze the results to gain a better understanding of the user's condition.

BUDGET ANALYSIS :

To create a budget for our project Adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) Educational Game for People with Neurodevelopmental Disorders project requires careful analysis and consideration of various factors. Here's an estimated budget breakdown:
Development of Adaptive VR Game: This includes the cost of designing and developing the VR game, including programming, art, sound, and other creative elements. The cost will depend on the complexity and features of the game, as well as the platform (e.g., PC, mobile, VR headset) we targeting. Content Creation: This includes creating educational content specifically tailored for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as curriculum development, instructional design, and content creation for the game. It may also include costs associated with obtaining appropriate licenses for educational content. VR Hardware and Software: This includes the cost of VR hardware, such as VR headsets, controllers and any necessary software or licenses for the VR development environment. Testing and Quality Assurance: This includes the cost of testing the VR game for usability, functionality, and compatibility with various devices and platforms, as well as addressing any issues that arise during testing.
